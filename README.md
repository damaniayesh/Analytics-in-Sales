# Analytics-in-Sales
The project provides a predictive model for forecasting product sales at specific stores, aiming to optimize inventory management and enhance profitability by leveraging data-driven insights.

# Introduction
Big Mart is a large retail chain that operates multiple stores across different locations. The data scientists at Big Mart have collected 2013 sales data for various products across 10 stores in different cities. The aim is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store. They want to leverage this data to build a predictive model that can accurately predict the sales of their products in order to optimize their inventory management and improve overall profitability.

# Dataset Description
1. **Item_Identifier:**	Unique product ID
2. **Item_Weight:**	Weight of product
3. **Item_Fat_Content:**	Whether the product is low fat or not
4. **Item_Visibility:**	The % of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product
5. **Item_Type:**	The category to which the product belongs
6. **Item_MRP:**	Maximum Retail Price (list price) of the product
7. **Outlet_Identifier:**	Unique store ID
8. **Outlet_Establishment_Year:**	The year in which store was established
9. **Outlet_Size	The size:** of the store in terms of ground area covered
10. **Outlet_Location_Type:**	The type of city in which the store is located
11. **Outlet_Type:**	Whether the outlet is just a grocery store or some sort of supermarket
12. **Item_Outlet_Sales:**	Sales of the product in a particular store. This is the outcome variable to be predicted.
 
# Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the sales of each product at different stores based on historical sales data and other relevant features. 
You are tasked with developing a machine learning model that takes into account historical sales data, product attributes, store information and any other relevant features available in the dataset. The model should be able to accurately predict the sales of each product at different stores. 

# Steps for implementing the project
1. Importing the Libraries
2. Performed exploratory data analysis
3. Trained and build the regression algorithms to predict the sales of a product in a particular store
4. Performed the feature importances and improve the model
5. Understand various model performance metrics and measure the performance of each model
